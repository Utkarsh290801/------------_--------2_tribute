      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California,
        and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. He grew up with one sister,
        Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a hobby. Jobs
        remembers his father as being very skilled at working with his hands.
        <br />
        In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California. This area, just
        south of Palo Alto, California, was becoming a center for electronics.
        Electronics form the basic elements of devices such as radios,
        televisions, stereos, and computers. At that time people started to
        refer to the area as "Silicon Valley." This is because a substance
        called silicon is used in the manufacturing of electronic parts.
        <br />
        As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself. He swam
        competitively, but was not interested in team sports or other group
        activities. He showed an early interest in electronics and gadgetry. He
        spent a lot of time working in the garage workshop of a neighbor who
        worked at Hewlett-Packard, an electronics manufacturer.
        <br />
        Jobs also enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Explorer Club. There he saw
        engineers demonstrate new products, and he saw his first computer at the
        age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted
        to work with computers.
        <br />
        While in high school Jobs attended lectures at the Hewlett-Packard
        plant. On one occasion he boldly asked William Hewlett (1931â€“2001), the
        president, for some parts he needed to complete a class project. Hewlett
        was so impressed he gave Jobs the parts, and offered him a summer
        internship at Hewlett-Packard.
